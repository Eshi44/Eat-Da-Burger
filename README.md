# Eat-Da-Burger   🍔  A Full-Stack Restaurant App Following the MVC Design

Eat-da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users view, order, and consume their personalized burgers using Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, and ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars are used to generate the HTML. 

Simply enter your buger of choice in the input field and click the utensils to order your burger. Your burger will show up in the 'To be eaten...' column. Upon clicking your beurger icon, your burger will then be devoured and move to the devoured column. Don't worry, y can always click on the eaten burger to eat it again!
