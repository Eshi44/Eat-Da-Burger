# Eat-Da-Burger
Following the MVC design, this app allows users to log burgers using Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, and ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars are used to generate the HTML.


## Eat-Da-Burger Info:

* Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Simply click the 'Devour It!' button to consume the burger and select the 'Eat It Again!' button until your're full! Use the form to submit the burger of your choosing to be eaten.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
